# Direct2D

This sample is based on the code from Microsoft at https://github.com/microsoft/Windows-classic-samples/tree/main/Samples/Win7Samples/begin/LearnWin32/Direct2DClock

Note that this sample works on x64 targets, but when tested on a Surface RT tablet no circle was drawn.
The reason for this failure has not been looked at yet.
